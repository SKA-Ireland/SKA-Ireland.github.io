# Background

This is the website of the SKA Ireland group. This is a group of Irish astronomers (i.e. astronomers in Ireland, Irish astronomers anywhere in the world) that are interested in the science that can be undertaken with the [Square Kilometre Array](https://www.skao.int). 

# Who Are We?

The SKA Ireland group (founded in May 2024) is constituted from professional astrophysicists and scientists of other disciplines (e.g. high performance computing). It includes members from 17 institutes on the island of Ireland and diaspora astronomers across the globe. SKA Ireland reports to the Astronomical Society of Ireland which is the professional body for Irish astronomers. 

# Goals
The over-arching goal of SKA Ireland is to have Irish scientists undertaking SKA science.
